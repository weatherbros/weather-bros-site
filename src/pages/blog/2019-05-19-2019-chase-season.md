It's here again!  After a year off in 2018, we're about to head back to the Plains so we can chase again.  Were leaving Tuesday night and will be out chasing through Monday the 27th.   It has been a sense of nervousness and excitement(maybe they are the same feeling) in the weeks leading up to this.  We selected this period to chase because it fell during the climatological peak of the tornado season in the Plains and we were able to maximize days chasing with a minimal amount of time off at work.  

When scheduling this, I did a lot of research into the potential amount of severe weather/tornado days that we could see on this chase.   Looking at the years 2005-2018, on average there were 5 chaseable days, 4 days with the potential to see tornadoes and 2 "good" chase days per year from May 22-May 27.  With these odds, we figured that we would have a good chase.  But as years like last year showed, nothing is guaranteed with weather.

Looking at long range forecasts my mood changed every day, but now that we are about to embark things are looking good for a chance to chase every day.  Of course we missed a good show on Friday May 17 and may miss an upcoming significant weather event on the 20th, but for now we are optimistic and excited about our chances.  We will be posting more as the week goes on.
